You just arrived to the web site of Ana Vi√±uela, a spanish scientist (eternally) under construction.

I am currently a researcher at the University of Geneva, visiting the Univerisity of Dundee as research associate. I am also an Honorary research associate at The Department of Twin Research, at King's College, were I collaborate in various projects focused on the genomics of aging.

My research interests include the role of genetic variation in the diversity of changes observed in gene expression with age. I am also interested on the genetics causes of age related diseases and other complex traits, like the development of diabetes and its progression with age.
